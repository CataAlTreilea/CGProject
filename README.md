# Shortest path in a polygon

Finds the shortest path between two points in a two-dimensional shape.

# Running

To run the project you will need Python 3.10 or later.
To install the necessary libraries run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can run the project as follows:

```bash
python -m main
```

After that, a figure with most of the world map will appear which is an example 
of polygons.
On that figure, you can click and the program will find and display the shortest
path between the places you clicked.
You can select a different polygon by rewriting in the code which file do you want to load in main.py
